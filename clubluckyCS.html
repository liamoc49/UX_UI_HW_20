        <h1>Executive Summary
        </h1>
        <p>The following is a UX project, in which my group and I worked together to create a music discovery app that
            would help solve the problem of people having trouble finding new music. The process to do this took several
            weeks in total as we conducted user research and competitor research, developed various prototypes, and
            finalized different elements of the project into one final iteration that we would then present to our
            bootcamp class. This process was not without its hurdles as we ran into issues in several places when it
            came to the topic of onboarding as well as making sure all of the scrolling elements of the project were
            able to work. That said the project was completed on time and was able to demonstrate what its purpose was.
        </p>
        <h1>Project Overview
        </h1>
        <p>To begin, this project was the first big group project that me or anyone in my class for the Northwestern
            University UX/UI Bootcamp had done. This was a project that made many of us test our limited knowledge of
            Figma at the time to create something that was functional and accessible. This meant making sure that not
            only did all of the interactions that we needed to work did work, but also that we had to make sure that a
            user could follow along with the on screen instructions and understand what all of those meant. Along the
            way with this project we delegated responsibilities for various different aspects such having one person
            work on creating the slides for the presentation, one person work on any UI elements that we needed made
            specifically for the project, and one person who worked graphics for the slides and the project. That said
            we did all work together to take on the task of creating the project and making sure the interactions
            worked.</p>

                            a group of three in which we were all responsibile for different parts of the project though
                            we did all work

                            reason for this

            <h1>P1: User Research</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <h6>When my group was tasked with the project of creating a new product or redesigning an existing
                    website, we were confused at first. This project was to be our last one during the bootcamp and as
                    such this was meant to incorporate elements of user experience, user interface, and front end
                    coding. </h6>
                <h6>The group ended up deciding on redesigning a local Chicago restaurants website that we found while
                    looking for ideas as to what we wanted to do. This restaurant was Club Lucky, an Italian cocktail
                    lounge and supper club from Chicago’s Wicker Park neighborhood. It was very clear from the first
                    time we looked at it that there was a lot that needed to be done with the restaurant's website with
                    one member of the group describing the website as giving off the vibe of an ‘Italian bowling alley’
                    which was not what the restaurant is. The website itself was a very cluttered design that seemed
                    very outdated and tacky. There was no clear tab on the navbar that indicated to you where the menu
                    was. The page layout changed drastically between pages. Much of the branding on the website was not
                    really unique or noticeable. It was from there that we realized that this website held a lot of
                    promise in terms of what someone could do with it. </h6>
                <h6>Our main goal with this redesign was to create a website with a focus on modernization and
                    accessibility and this would be achieved by rebranding the website with a more unique and distinct
                    look and feel, overhauling the layout of the website, and promoting consistency between pages.

            <h1>P2: Definition & Synthesis</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <h6>Before we could redesign the website, we first had to understand what would people want out of this
                    website and what did they think about the current website. The first part of our research was us
                    conducting surveys using google surveys to understand not only what users want from restaurant
                    websites but also how often they use them and how often they eat out. These questions are important
                    as it gives us a baseline to understand where we should be taking the project. We also conducted
                    interviews to get a bit more of an in depth understanding about what some people thought, here are
                    some of there comments include:</h6>
                <h6>{
                    “No prices or if the menu is so out of date that it is different when you get to the restaurant”
                    “Poor functionality, outdated menu, outdated hours, anything that makes it remotely difficult to
                    find the menu, comic sans font”
                    “when the website is busy and i cannot easily focus on one item, image quality is not good, there
                    are too many options in the website menu, when it is hard to find the information i am looking for”}
                </h6>
                <h6>We took these results from both the surveys and the interviews and made affinity diagrams from them.
                    Which helped us narrow down what exactly we might want to focus on. The three big findings that came
                    out from the survey and the interview was that users wanted to be ab;e to find the menu right away,
                    users wanted better UX from the website, and users often felt confused or overwhelmed by how much
                    information was on the page. We also found out that most users ate out at least once a week. </h6>
                <h6>It was from these findings that we created our user persona Jenny Barker, a 25 year old travel
                    influencer who is looking for places to visit on an upcoming trip back home to Chicago. She wants to
                    try new places to spread the word about them, but has a hard time going through websites with
                    out-dated and confusing designs.</h6>
                <h6>From our research we also created a feature prioritization matrix from our findings and found that
                    the most important aspects of the website that we needed to stress in the redesign were clear
                    website navigation, menu, online ordering, prices, hours, location, and more images.

            <div class="container">
                <h6>As we collected our user research and began looking at the different ways we could solve the problem
                    of
                    creating a new way to discover music, we all did sketches of various different ideas of where we
                    should
                    take the project. It was from these paper prototypes that we started to notice some common ideas
                    that we
                    all had such as the ability to tell the app about your personal taste in music as well as the
                    ability to
                    link the app to your spotify or apple music accounts. It was through this collobration that we were
                    able
                    to start to build a fuller picture of what would end up becoming the lo-fi and mid-fi prototypes of
                    the
                    project. Along the way we would settle on the name Forte as it helped tie into the music theme of
                    the
                    app, helped to show how we were trying to signal boost smaller artists, and lastly to show how the
                    app
                    could be personalized to the users tastes in music.</h6>

            <div class="container">
                <h6>Once we finished looking over our findings, we all sketched up ideas for what we thought a redesign
                    of the website might look like. While there was some overlap in design when it came to sketches, we
                    did vote on what elements we thought should stay for the lo-fi prototype, this included having the
                    navigation be on top of the screen instead of on the side, have location, hours, and contact
                    information on the frontpage, as well as some way to become involved with club lucky. </h6>
                <h6>After we finished the paper prototype, I created a composite version of the prototypes that would
                    serve as a lo-gi prototype. We would use this prototype as a way to test potential color schemes
                    with use of grays, whites, and reds. This prototype would also include the first instants of the
                    redesigned logo. The “CL” that would be seen on all future iterations. The CL was one of few designs
                    that were tossed around for the redesign; others included a gangster in the style of a 1930s cartoon
                    to play up the fact that one of the past lives of this restaurant was a speakeasy, another was a
                    cartoon cat that tattered and ragged with a scar over its eye to create the illusion of a C and an
                    L. Ultimately we would go with the simple CL that you see now as it had an elegance and uniqueness
                    that worked with the rest of the redesign, though elements of the cat design still peeked out in the
                    end with the CL looking like an eye with a slit pupil.</h6>
                <h6>From there we continued to refine the design and created a mid-fi prototype that started to be
                    filled with actual content, not just the placeholder text from the lo-fi prototype. There were also
                    some parts of the lo-fi that had to be scrapped due them not being feasible with the time and lack
                    of front end coding knowledge that we had. This includes things like a proposed social media feed
                    that showed images of people posted to twitter and instagram involving the restaurant. What was able
                    to be added during this phase of development was more stylized components and more varied fonts as
                    well as the choice to move the logo from the side of the navbar to the center. </h6>
                <h6>When it came to the hi-fi iteration of the prototype there was not much that substantially changed
                    with the overall design of the website, but we did go further in depth with changes we were already
                    making. We also had to be careful at this point in the project in particular because we knew we had
                    to be able to make whatever we did in Figma in github. While this was not a complete 1:1 recreation
                    in the end there were definitely elements that we still had to consider. That said, we were able to
                    create a hi-fi website that was able to deliver on our goals as well as being able to be translated
                    into a coded website. We were able to create a website that felt more modern and unique as well as
                    having the information people would be looking for upfront for them. We also were able to add extra
                    design flourishes like the dip in the top navbar where the logo was, add transitions between pages,
                    and create a page that helped explain a little bit about the history of the restaurant to what you
                    should expect from this restaurant.

                <h6>In the end, there was a lot that we learned from this project, whether that be that people are not
                    just looking at restaurant websites for their menus, the importance of having things line up with
                    people’s expectations, and even the importance of less is more. Expectations have been a big focus
                    of this redesign because it is so important to let users know what they should expect when they go
                    to your website, but also that there is a lot that users expect to find on websites that can often
                    be lost if you do not understand that.</h6>
                <h6>Lastly, If we were to continue this project there would be a couple of things that we would want to
                    try and focus on. The first step would be to try and reach out to Club Lucky with this prototype to
                    see what they think of it. The second step would be to continue to iterate on the website design and
                    layout, such as working on a mobile version of the website. Lastly, we would program and code more
                    of the website.

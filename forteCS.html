        <h1>Executive Summary
        </h1>
        <p>The following is a UX project, in which my group and I worked together to create a music discovery app that
            would help solve the problem of people having trouble finding new music. The process to do this took several
            weeks in total as we conducted user research and competitor research, developed various prototypes, and
            finalized different elements of the project into one final iteration that we would then present to our
            bootcamp class. This process was not without its hurdles as we ran into issues in several places when it
            came to the topic of onboarding as well as making sure all of the scrolling elements of the project were
            able to work. That said the project was completed on time and was able to demonstrate what its purpose was.
        </p>
        <h1>Project Overview
        </h1>
        <p>To begin, this project was the first big group project that me or anyone in my class for the Northwestern
            University UX/UI Bootcamp had done. This was a project that made many of us test our limited knowledge of
            Figma at the time to create something that was functional and accessible. This meant making sure that not
            only did all of the interactions that we needed to work did work, but also that we had to make sure that a
            user could follow along with the on screen instructions and understand what all of those meant. Along the
            way with this project we delegated responsibilities for various different aspects such having one person
            work on creating the slides for the presentation, one person work on any UI elements that we needed made
            specifically for the project, and one person who worked graphics for the slides and the project. That said
            we did all work together to take on the task of creating the project and making sure the interactions
            worked.</p>

                            a group of three in which we were all responsibile for different parts of the project though
                            we did all work

            <div class="container">
            <h6>After the inital brainstorming process in which we settled on the idea of something like a tinder but for
                finding music, we realized that we needed to figure who our users might be. our inital ideas were that
                they might be someone in thier late twenties who is always in search for the next big thing when it
                comes to music and they were bored with what thier Spotify recommended playlists were giving because it
                was either the same thing on repeat or nothing that interested them. Once we did our research we
                realized that our assumptions were right partially.</h6>

        <h6>From there we went about looking at possible copetitors as well as thinking about how we could implement
            those ideas into an app. This made us realize that the apps that were out there that did something
            similar to what we were trying to accomplish had an issue and that was that they were not really
            designed to look good or be inviting. We realized that we needed to more than just show people new music
            that there needed to be a way to sort and organize that information as well as refine the search to
            focus on something for a partial area of focus.</h6>

        <div class="container">
        <h6>As we collected our user research and began looking at the different ways we could solve the problem of
            creating a new way to discover music, we all did sketches of various different ideas of where we should
            take the project. It was from these paper prototypes that we started to notice some common ideas that we
            all had such as the ability to tell the app about your personal taste in music as well as the ability to
            link the app to your spotify or apple music accounts. It was through this collobration that we were able
            to start to build a fuller picture of what would end up becoming the lo-fi and mid-fi prototypes of the
            project. Along the way we would settle on the name Forte as it helped tie into the music theme of the
            app, helped to show how we were trying to signal boost smaller artists, and lastly to show how the app
            could be personalized to the users tastes in music.</h6>

        <h1>P4: Prototyping (Lo-Fi)</h1>
        <div class="container">
        <h6>When it came to the topic of prototyping and intial designs for Forte, one element that did not change
            much was the design of the main screen that the user would interact with. We knew early on that the main
            focus of the screen needs to be the music whether that is an album cover or an image that was used to
            represent the artist and that along with that we wanted to have the two main interactions on the screen
            to be a like/dislike or yes/no option to avoid confusion. While this might have been the first screen
            what we thought we did build the app up around it. We realized that we needed to give people the option
            to personalize their taste in music both during the onboarding process as well as afterwards. The
            thoughts of what we needed to put into the onboarding process then grew from there as we had to figure
            out what information that we thought was needed from the users and what was not really that required
            from them.</h6>

        <h1>P5: User Testing + Outcomes</h1>
        <div class="container">
        <h6>From our user testing, we found some key findings. Some of the biggest feedback we got was the importance
            adding accessibility options to Forte to help show that the user was in fact interacting with the app
            and that their actions were being recognized. We also found out that we needed to include some form of a
            tutorial for new users as part of the on boarding process. Once we did that we then we went out and did
            some more testing on the changes we made to Forte and found that there was room for further
            accessability changes and refinements, notibily giving the users more of an indication that certain
            elements of the screen and pages can be scrolled through and that users wanted there to be more
            information on the app explaning how linking your Forte account to Spotify or Apple Music. </h6>

        <h6>In the end, through the hard work and dedication of our team we were able to fine tune our prototype into
            something that can change the way we discover new music. That said there is still room for Forte to
            group. One big feature that we all thought would help this app would be the ability to have Forte be
            able to promote up-and-coming artists as well as find more ways to personalize your Forte through more
            options and algorthims that could potentially support and app like this.</h6>

        <h6>Ultimately through the clear visual hierarchy and consistent language, we were able to create a prototype that we are proud of. </h6>

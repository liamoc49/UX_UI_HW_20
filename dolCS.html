        <h1>Executive Summary
        </h1>
        <p>The following is a UX project, in which my group and I worked together to create a music discovery app that
            would help solve the problem of people having trouble finding new music. The process to do this took several
            weeks in total as we conducted user research and competitor research, developed various prototypes, and
            finalized different elements of the project into one final iteration that we would then present to our
            bootcamp class. This process was not without its hurdles as we ran into issues in several places when it
            came to the topic of onboarding as well as making sure all of the scrolling elements of the project were
            able to work. That said the project was completed on time and was able to demonstrate what its purpose was.
        </p>
        <h1>Project Overview
        </h1>
        <p>To begin, this project was the first big group project that me or anyone in my class for the Northwestern
            University UX/UI Bootcamp had done. This was a project that made many of us test our limited knowledge of
            Figma at the time to create something that was functional and accessible. This meant making sure that not
            only did all of the interactions that we needed to work did work, but also that we had to make sure that a
            user could follow along with the on screen instructions and understand what all of those meant. Along the
            way with this project we delegated responsibilities for various different aspects such having one person
            work on creating the slides for the presentation, one person work on any UI elements that we needed made
            specifically for the project, and one person who worked graphics for the slides and the project. That said
            we did all work together to take on the task of creating the project and making sure the interactions
            worked.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The redesign project for the Department of Labor began as a two-person
                            project when it came to the ideation and brainstorming aspect of the project but after that
                            the project was done independently. Because of this, my role was to figure out a better,
                            more modern and accessible desktop and mobile website for the department of labor.

                            created a new logo for the Department of Labor with a focus on trying to incorporate themes
                            of various different types of labor throughout history which included ideas of farming,
                            industry, technology, architecture, and interconnectedness while also taking inspiration
                            from government signs from the 1970s as well as the iconography of EPCOT in Walt Disney
                            World.

            <h1>P1: User Research</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <h6>To begin, the first thing we did was look at the current US Department of Labor website to see what
                    some of the most glaring problems facing the website are. This included looking at how menus were
                    structured, seeing what information was prioritized as well as noting areas that needed changes.
                    From this initial look at the website we then decided on what questions we needed to ask
                    interviewees about during testing. We also took the time to create a proto-persona of who we thought
                    might be using the US Department of Labor website. This led to the creation of Joe B. Less, a
                    recently laid off designer that is trying to figure out how to support his family. </h6>
                <h6>From the interviews, it was clear that one of the biggest issues with the current website had to do
                    with information architecture and the fact that there are a lot of things that users can click on to
                    learn more, but most of them are not really obvious or overlap with other options. These insights
                    helped a lot because it gave us the direction we needed to better understand where we needed to
                    focus our efforts.From these interviews we took the responses and then created an affinity diagram
                    to help understand what some common themes we found were as well as using those themes to create a
                    prioritization matrix to help understand what aspects of the website needed the most improvement. It
                    was around this time that we refined our proto-persona into our user persona and broke up into
                    independent projects.</h6>

            <h1>P2: Definition & Synthesis</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <h6>After that we then went through the website to make annotations to note different aspects of the website that needed to be changed or improved that we came up with from a mixture of user testing and personal overview of the website. This was done on multiple pages including the homepage, the about us, the termination page, and the Unemployment Insurance Relief During COVID-19 Outbreak page which was by far one of the longest pages of the website as it featured information that related to every state.
                </h6>

            <h1>P3: Ideation</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <h6>During the ideation phase we also worked on moodboards that in the end did not really get used as much as planned, though it was from this process that I came up with the idea of creating a more modern and unique logo for the Department of Labor and found out about logo designs from the 1970s for the Department of the Interior and NASA that helped to serve as inspiration for the logo that I would create for this project. Other aspects of the project that did end up coming through with this step ended up being the taking inspiration from other government websites like the White House’s website as well as of all places the California DMV.</h6>
                <h6>Before beginning the design step of the project there was another round of user testing with this one focusing much more on the navigation. This ended up reaffirming to me that navigation was the biggest hurdle to overcome with this website, while also making it clear where you needed to go for finding things such as information on being laid off or starting a new business.</h6>

        <section id="phase4">
            <h1>P4: Prototyping (Lo-Fi)</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <h6>The first thing I set out doing when I was sketching out redesigns for the website was making sure the information that people would be looking for was front and center and that it was clear where on the website you had to go for each section. This is why there is the big carousel on the jumbotron as well as the four different tabs right next to it that read “For Employees”, “For Employers”, “Assistance”, and “Agencies” though the exact names and order of these tabs changes over the course of the development. This was because navigation was one of the biggest issues with the previous version of the website and that was something I was trying to correct.</h6>
                <h6>Around this same time I was working on seeing what could be done to improve clarity of information as well as not making looking at a submenu be a nightmare to navigate. This is where the four different tabs mentioned above come from as do the four buttons in the navbar of calendar, news, careers, and contact. While I was able to reduce most of the clutter of the submenus of the homepage there were some spots that were not always the easiest. For example, with the Assistance tab it has by far the most amount of options that someone can click on any of the four main tabs, but this was also what led me to figure out how I should organize the information inside of each tab and have everything be evenly spaced.</h6>
                <h6>Along with designing for a desktop page this was also the first project I had to design for mobile, which is where you can see the biggest number of changes between the rough lo-fi prototypes and the hi-fi prototypes that were delivered in the end. The mobile version was meant to follow a similar look to the desktop version though the idea was to have it be more focused on using a hamburger menu to navigate through the main pages and topics instead of the jumbotron that was used in the desktop version. The design for the mobile version was also much more focused on feeling like an app than something like a normal website.</h6>

            <h1>P5: User Testing + Outcomes</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <h6>The next step was to test the prototypes which I conducted a 5 second test to see what stuck out the most to people about the website. The general thoughts from testers was that the website seemed clean but that is was also clear that it was a work in progress, They liked the arrow that appeared next to the one of the four topics when you click on it was an interesting way to show where you were, the footer seemed to have a good layout with specific notes to the fact that you can find the phone number at the bottom of the screen, and lastly, only one person noticed that the word carousel on the prototype was misspelled.</h6>
                <h6>Along the way, I started working on updating the website to be closer to the hi-fi prototype by replacing filler text and putting actual content on the prototype. I also began gathering elements for a UI style tile as well as a style guide for easy reference for working on the project later. This is when different elements of the project fell into place such as choosing a color scheme, typeface, and various components that could be used for different functions. I would then take these changes and prepare to do one final round of testing.</h6>

                <h6>The final usability testing was conducted two ways, one way through Zoom calls while others were conducted by using the website Maze to have people test the prototype that way. The tests involved the users trying to find different information on the website such as contact information, unemployment information, and information about COVID-19. From this testing I found out {text containing the following: Most testers were confused between the option for “Assistance” and “For Employees”
                    All mobile testers understood that the logo would take them back to the home screen when touched
                    I forgot that one of my tasks involved an interaction that should have been linked when asking about trying to find information on COVID-19 and there being an article right below the fold about it that could not be clicked

                <h6>It was from this feedback that I made the changes for the final iteration for this project. {gifs of both versions will be next to this block of text} I was able to learn a lot from this both when it came to having to think about designing a website for mobile and desktop at the same time, but also the importance of remaining consistent when designing. It is important to bring this up as this was the first project from the bootcamp that called for using a grid column structure that we would be using in all other projects going forward which despite the growing pains that came with learning a new system was very helpful in understanding how I should layout a page.</h6>

                <h6>As for what I hope to do in the future with this project, I hope to continue to build out the website in both terms of usability and design, I hope to work on a tablet version of the website as neither the desktop or mobile versions of the website that I made are optimized for a tablet, lastly, my biggest point that I would want to change is to find more ways to incorporate elements from the logo redesign. I say this because the new logo has a strong sense of theming and a unique identity to it that incorporating elements of it into the rest of the website would be a missed opportunity.  </h6>

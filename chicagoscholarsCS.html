        <h1>Executive Summary
        </h1>
        <p>The following is a UX project, in which my group and I worked together to create a music discovery app that
            would help solve the problem of people having trouble finding new music. The process to do this took several
            weeks in total as we conducted user research and competitor research, developed various prototypes, and
            finalized different elements of the project into one final iteration that we would then present to our
            bootcamp class. This process was not without its hurdles as we ran into issues in several places when it
            came to the topic of onboarding as well as making sure all of the scrolling elements of the project were
            able to work. That said the project was completed on time and was able to demonstrate what its purpose was.
        </p>
        <h1>Project Overview
        </h1>
        <p>To begin, this project was the first big group project that me or anyone in my class for the Northwestern
            University UX/UI Bootcamp had done. This was a project that made many of us test our limited knowledge of
            Figma at the time to create something that was functional and accessible. This meant making sure that not
            only did all of the interactions that we needed to work did work, but also that we had to make sure that a
            user could follow along with the on screen instructions and understand what all of those meant. Along the
            way with this project we delegated responsibilities for various different aspects such having one person
            work on creating the slides for the presentation, one person work on any UI elements that we needed made
            specifically for the project, and one person who worked graphics for the slides and the project. That said
            we did all work together to take on the task of creating the project and making sure the interactions
            worked.</p>

            <h1>P1: User Research</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <h6>When we first looked at the Chicago Scholars website it was very obvious that it was in need of a
                    redesign as accessibility and responsiveness were two of the major issues that were most apparent.
                    The colors used on the website for backgrounds and fonts were very difficult to distinguish, the
                    branding and theming of the website was very bland using a lot of grays and whites with some blues
                    and reds to mimic the Chicago flag, and it was not clear as to what the website was for from the
                    homepage. After further inspection of the site we also found that much of the information
                    architecture and grouping of like information was not well put together.</h6>
            </div>

            <h1>P2: Definition & Synthesis</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <h6> After looking over the problems with the website, we began working on developing an idea of what
                    our
                    users would be. While we originally were torn between whether to focus on designing for both
                    potential mentors and mentees, we ultimately decided it would be best to focus on designing the
                    experience for the mentors and educating users on what Chicago Scholars is and what they do. </h6>
                <h6> What also helped shape this persona was interviews conducted with people who fit our target
                    audience and competitor analysis of four separate websites. In total we conducted seven interviews
                    with various different individuals who were between the ages of twenty-one to thirty-five. These
                    individuals all had different backgrounds with some of them being teachers and students to some
                    being in the service industry and another who was a journalist. </h6>
                <h6> As for competitor analysis there were four websites we used to compare Chicago Scholars with, those
                    being Mentor.com, Triplethreat.org, Champs Male Mentoring Program, and Big Brothers Big Sisters of
                    America. While each website had its pros and cons with stand outs being that Champs had an issue of
                    clearness and readability with its branding, conversely Big Brothers Big Sisters had strong branding
                    and was very consistent. Another thing that all of these websites had that Chicago Scholars did not
                    have was that it was much clearer as to what these websites were about and how you could get
                    involved. It was from this research that we were able to understand what different elements we
                    wanted to include in our redesign of the website.</h6>

            <h1>P3: Ideation</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <h6>When it came time to help make sense of some of our research one tool we used was a storyboard to
                    help explain why someone might want to use Chicago Scholars and what they might get out of it.
                    {image with the storyboard found here}</h6>
                <h6> Along with this understanding of how someone might want to try our website we also had to find what
                    needed to be done to change and simplify the onboarding experience for a new user. This leads to a
                    user flow that you see in all of the prototypes where is multiple ways on the homepage to become a
                    mentor working with Chicago Scholars.

            <h1>P4: Prototyping (Lo-Fi)</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <h6>From there we got to drafting different ideas for what we wanted to do for prototypes of the redesigns. Some of these redesigns focused more on simplicity and form such as helping people understand the who, where, how, and why of the organization while others focused more on who and the what of the organization and their accomplishments. In the end, we went with a design that took aspects from both and prototypes with a greater emphasis on showing what Chicago Scholars does and what they have historically done.

            <h1>P5: User Testing + Outcomes</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <h6>We then did some testing to see what needed to be changed or improved. The biggest change that you would see when it comes to the various different prototypes in both the mobile and desktop versions of the website is how the navbar and information was presented on the homepage. While there was some disagreement over how things like  the navbar was presented, in the end we were able to reach a compromise about how to best format the website to best serve the users. As for the mobile version of the website the design was very different from the desktop with the decision being made to have the mobile version of the website have this ‘infinite’ scrolling aspect to it as you learn more about the organization.  </h6>
                <h6>Some of the key takeaways from the testing on the different versions of the website was that “infinite” scrolling navigation on mobile was too much and that the sign up process on mobile was confusing. Other insights we received were that users thought information was very clear and that they liked the layout of the website.</h6>

            <h1>P6: Conclusion + Future Opportunities</h1>
            <div class="container conclu">
                <h6>In the end, what we learned from this project in general was the importance of accessibility and testing, but also that having a clear idea for what you want your website to look like early is very important whether it be when it comes something as general as layout to more specific aspects like the font size and theming.
                </h6>

                <h6>If we were to continue with this project we would strive for greater design consistency and clearer directing as to where users need to go on the pages. We would also try to expand the scope of the redesign from not just the onboarding process but to the rest of the website.

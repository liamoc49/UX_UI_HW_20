        <h1>Executive Summary
        </h1>
        <p>The following is a UX project where the prompt was to create an app that was somehow related to travel. I took this prompt and thought about how there are not any travel apps that really helped people figure where they could go next. This was the general idea for what would become Placeholder, an app that would give you suggestions as to where you might want to go and what you might want to do when you get there. Through developing this idea, there were repeated interviews and testing done to improve the usability of the app with a large part of the effort being put towards the onboarding process. 

        </p>
        <h1>Project Overview
        </h1>
        <p>To begin, this was the first project I had ever worked on for the Northwestern University UX/UI Bootcamp. This project was a big test on learning the basics of Figma as well as the basics of design. This can be seen through certain steps in the design process being a mixture of rushed or lacking as I was still learning. That said this project did not begin as an individual endeavor as the user research and definition steps on the design process were done in a group of two and then the rest of the project being done individually. This meant that all of the ideation, prototyping, and user testing that was done by myself which led to having to manage my time as I made sure everything got done on time.

                        <p class="card-text">My role for this project was mostly an individual role as I was responsible for design, planning, testing, and creating the interactions. The project began in groups of two for the task of initial user testing and persona creation but after that we worked separately to create the same general product, a travel app for people who are not sure where they want to go.

            <h1>P1: User Research</h1>
            <div class="container">
            <h6>To begin, when it came to user research a big focus was on trying to figure out if a travel app that would help recommend where you should go for your next vacation was something that people wanted. While most of our research at this point showed that people had other issues that related to travel that they had, there was still enough of an interest in this topic that we went forward with the idea.</h6>

        <h1>P2: Definition & Synthesis</h1>
        <div class="container">
        <h6>It was around this point in the process that we thought that giving people suggestions on where they might want to go could be expanded upon to include things like giving people suggestions of things to do and attractions to visit while they are on vacation. On top of that became the decision on how we might obtain user information to tailor the in app experience to better suit their particular taste, this lead to the idea of having part of the on boarding process include an option to either tell the app what are some places that they liked visiting and what might be some of their interests. The wording and presentation of information during this part of the development process was very important to consider because of the fact that this is private and personal information related to the users and that we are aware that companies have a history of taking and selling this information. </h6>

        <h1>P3: Ideation</h1>
        <div class="container">
        <h6>As we collected our user research and began looking at the different ways we could solve the problem of
            creating a new way to discover music, we all did sketches of various different ideas of where we should
            take the project. It was from these paper prototypes that we started to notice some common ideas that we
            all had such as the ability to tell the app about your personal taste in music as well as the ability to
            link the app to your spotify or apple music accounts. It was through this collobration that we were able
            to start to build a fuller picture of what would end up becoming the lo-fi and mid-fi prototypes of the
            project. Along the way we would settle on the name Forte as it helped tie into the music theme of the
            app, helped to show how we were trying to signal boost smaller artists, and lastly to show how the app
            could be personalized to the users tastes in music.</h6>

        <h1>P4: Prototyping (Lo-Fi)</h1>
        <div class="container">
        <h6>When it came to the topic of prototyping and intial designs for Forte, one element that did not change
            much was the design of the main screen that the user would interact with. We knew early on that the main
            focus of the screen needs to be the music whether that is an album cover or an image that was used to
            represent the artist and that along with that we wanted to have the two main interactions on the screen
            to be a like/dislike or yes/no option to avoid confusion. While this might have been the first screen
            what we thought we did build the app up around it. We realized that we needed to give people the option
            to personalize their taste in music both during the onboarding process as well as afterwards. The
            thoughts of what we needed to put into the onboarding process then grew from there as we had to figure
            out what information that we thought was needed from the users and what was not really that required
            from them.</h6>
            <h6>Despite all of these features and functions that the prototype would ultimately show, the earliest forms of the prototype focused heavily on incorporating a strong onboarding process that not only would be telling the users how this app would work, but explaining why it was asking for specific information from them. </h6>

        <h1>P5: User Testing + Outcomes</h1>
        <div class="container">
        <h6>From initial user testing, it was clear that the app was far from perfect as much of the feedback I received related to the order and amount of forms that the app asked you to fill out while you were going through the onboarding process. Other feedback had to do with clarity of elements on the screen and how the pages looked. </h6>

        <h1>P6: Conclusion + Future Opportunities</h1>
        <div class="container conclu">
        <h6>In the end, it was clear that this was a first attempt from someone who was new to this field, but that led to further refinements and changes being made. Those changes included shifting the order of the onboarding process and adding more very plain and uninspired screens amongst other things to give the app its own identity. This meant creating a logo for the app, going and removing the default placeholder images on the screens and elements that I used from element libraries and using instead images from my various vacations. 
        </h6>

        <h6>If I were to continue working on this app in the future, there are a number of things that I would do, whether that be working with back-end developers and programmers to see if creating an algorithm for an app like this could be possible, allow a way for local businesses and people to submit different attractions to Placeholder to help promote them when it comes to giving users the option to view attractions nearby the area they are visiting.</h6>
